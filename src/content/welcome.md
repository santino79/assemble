Hi! My name is [Alan Hylands](https://alanhylands.com) and this is Analysts Assemble. 

I interview data analysts and data professionals of all specialities and ask them to share their tips, tricks and career stories to help us all 
become better data analysts.

And, more importantly, how to use those skills to build better, more profitable data-informed businesses.
